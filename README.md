# iNET would have been nice. Except it is not longer its own project. If you would like a semi-stable server, you should go [HERE](https://github.com/thelucyclub/iNET/), or [HERE](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys)

## A message from @thelucyclub :
iNET was turning out to be great. And it would have been. Except, someone removed all of MY code, and added Genisys code, claiming it was iNETs. I'm sorry I had to do this, but we do not want to end up like ImagicalMine.
